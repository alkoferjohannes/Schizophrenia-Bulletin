==================================================

I've battled severe anxiety for over 15 years. My journey began in my twenties with overwhelming panic attacks triggered by everyday situations like dining at restaurants and standing in line at the supermarket. This fear soon spread to the point where I couldn't leave my home without feeling anxious. My life became a constant cycle of avoidance, and I lost friendships, relationships, and business opportunities as a result.

Determined not to let anxiety define my life, I embarked on a quest for healing. I tried everything – therapy, hypnotherapy, exercise, diets, fasting retreats, and self-help books. It wasn't one specific treatment that helped; rather, it was the combination of multiple strategies. This realization inspired me to write my book, Fearless Living, and develop the Anxiety Checklist. These tools represent my arsenal against anxiety, and they have been pivotal in helping me regain control over my life.

In the book, I describe how anxiety is often your body's way of signaling that something is wrong. It usually arises when emotions are not released in a healthy way. Through my journey, I learned that understanding and confronting childhood traumas, recognizing present-day triggers, and embracing methods like emotional release through crying are essential to managing anxiety.

One of the turning points in my journey was a hypnotherapy session that brought my stress level from an eight to a one. For three years following that session, my anxiety vanished. I felt liberated and free to live my life again. However, life is ever-changing, and as new challenges and relationship dynamics arose, anxiety crept back into my life. It was a reminder that the battle with anxiety is not a one-time fix but an ongoing process of understanding, confronting, and adapting to life's circumstances.

Through it all, I learned to live with my anxiety rather than trying to eliminate it completely. The creation of the Anxiety Checklist was my way of providing a practical, hands-on guide for others to use as they navigate their own journeys. This checklist includes a 12-section plan, covering areas from understanding anxiety to practicing mindfulness, incorporating cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques, and making lifestyle changes. It’s designed to help others track their progress and explore the best tools and techniques to combat anxiety.

ADAA's resources have been invaluable in my journey, offering insights and support that made me feel less alone. The information and community have helped me understand my condition better and equipped me with strategies to manage it.

Now, at 42, I continue to live with anxiety, but on my terms. I view anxiety not as an enemy to be vanquished but as a part of my journey toward self-understanding and growth. By sharing my story and the tools that have helped me via my books and with ADAA, I hope to inspire others to take control of their lives and pursue their own path toward fearless living.

I encourage anyone struggling with anxiety to seek a range of methods and therapies, find what resonates with them, and be patient with the process. Remember, you are not alone, and there is a path to a life where anxiety doesn't control you.

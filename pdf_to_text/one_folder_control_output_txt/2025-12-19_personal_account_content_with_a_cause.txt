==================================================

Five years ago, I faced one of the toughest decisions of my life—telling my boss that I had Bipolar Disorder 2. HR advised me to keep it quiet, warning that others might feel uncomfortable if they knew. For 2.5 years, I stayed silent, hiding a huge part of who I was while struggling with the weight of my condition. It wasn’t easy to keep it to myself, especially in a professional environment where mental health is often misunderstood. Those years of silence deepened the loneliness I felt, making me more determined to break free from the stigma.

Eventually, I made the choice to speak out publicly about my experience. It was terrifying, but once I shared my story, everything changed. Opening up allowed me to connect with others facing similar struggles, and I realized that my voice could make a difference. I felt liberated and empowered, and I discovered that vulnerability wasn’t a weakness—it was a strength. Speaking up became not only a path to healing for myself, but a way to inspire others to share their stories and challenge the stigma that surrounds mental health.

As Co-CEO of PiZetta Media, I’ve made it my mission to integrate my mental health journey into the work we do. Through our YouTube channel with over 70K subscribers and one of the top mental health podcasts, I’ve been able to reach people in ways I never imagined. PiZetta Media is all about creating authentic, meaningful content that sparks real conversations. I’ve found that people are hungry for stories that reflect their own experiences and show them they’re not alone. Every piece of content we produce is an opportunity to amplify voices that often go unheard.

One of the most eye-opening lessons I’ve learned is how deeply misunderstood mental health still is. There’s a tendency to view conditions like Bipolar Disorder as a weakness, especially in professional spaces, but I’ve come to realize that embracing vulnerability makes you stronger, not weaker. This realization has fueled my passion to use PiZetta Media as a platform for change. Our goal is to create content that educates, challenges stigma, and brings real, unfiltered stories to light. The response from our audience has shown me just how powerful and necessary these conversations are.

Reflecting on my journey, I never imagined that sharing my personal struggles would lead to such a widespread impact. Today, I feel a deep sense of responsibility to keep pushing the conversation forward, not just for myself but for the millions of people living with mental health conditions who deserve to be heard and understood. The more I share, the more I realize how important it is to challenge the silence around mental health and create space for openness and understanding.

Treatment has been a vital part of my journey. I see both a psychiatrist and a therapist regularly, and I take medication daily to manage my Bipolar Disorder 2. This has made an incredible difference in my life. The combination of therapy and medication has helped stabilize my moods, allowing me to manage the highs and lows with much more control and understanding. It has enabled me to not only function but to thrive, both in my personal life and professionally. Treatment has been the foundation that allows me to keep moving forward, doing the work I love, and advocating for others.

Through PiZetta Media, I am committed to continuing this mission—building connections, empowering voices, and fostering a world where mental health is talked about openly, respected, and supported in every aspect of life. It’s been a long journey, but one that has given me purpose, and I’m proud to be a part of creating that change.

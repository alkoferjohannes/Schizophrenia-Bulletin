==================================================

Have you ever seen a person walking on a tightrope suspended 150 feet above a deep gorge? What do they strive for most? Balance! That’s exactly what someone suffering from bipolar disorder requires most in their life.

Teetering on a Tightrope, my bipolar journey, is the story of my lifelong battle for balance. For most of my 73 years I have suffered from bipolar disorder. Descending into the depths of suicidal intentions or rising to the high of watching the births of my children, I have endured a roller coaster ride of epic proportions.

My memoir takes the reader on a chronological journey of emotions recounting my rape when I was nine years old, my desire to take my own life and my attempt to kill my father. It recounts my voyage through therapy and my successes and failures using prescribed psychological medications and highlights my recovery. One on one therapy and finding the right combo of psych meds was instrumental in my recovery.

For the last seven years I have been the facilitator of two mental health support groups in Phoenix, Arizona. Through my own experiences and those of the numerous people I have worked with, I consider myself to be pretty damn knowledgeable on real life bipolar disorder. I reached out to ADAA because my research on who to contact showed that the organization is considered as one of the best.

Teetering is both a deeply personal memoir and a call to action, rallying the reader to dismantle the stigma surrounding mental illness and find the support they need to resurrect their lives. My memoir will be released January 24, 2023. If you are interested in inviting me to be a guest on your podcast or in any other capacity please email me at swwilson.wilson@gmail.com.

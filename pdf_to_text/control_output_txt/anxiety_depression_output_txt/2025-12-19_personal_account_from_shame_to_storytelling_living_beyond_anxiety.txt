==================================================

I have spent countless nights trapped in my own mind, where sleep feels like a distant memory and reality blurs into something unrecognizable. Anxiety doesn’t just whisper—it screams. It fills my head with thoughts I never asked for, thoughts that claw at me, that make my heart race for no reason, that convince me something terrible is always waiting just around the corner.

Drowning—that’s the only way I can describe it. Sinking in a pool of thoughts so deep, so endless, that I can’t see the surface. The “what ifs” wrap around me like unseen currents, pulling me under. What if I’m not good enough? What if something terrible happens? What if I never get better? What if I die? The weight of it all presses down on me, and no matter how much I struggle, I can’t seem to come up for air.

My anxiety doesn’t rest. It lurks in the background, waiting for a quiet moment to strike. The thoughts feel so real, so vivid, that for a second, I almost believe them. That’s the scariest part—how real it all feels.

I couldn’t tell if I was awake or still dreaming. I couldn’t differentiate whether it was a dream, reality, or my own thoughts. The lines blurred so much that I questioned everything. Had something really happened, or was it just my imagination?  I felt like I was living in a fog, disconnected from the world and from myself.

And then there’s the fear of dying. The thought that lingers, no matter how much I try to push it away. My heart races, my chest tightens, my hands go numb. I tell myself it’s just anxiety, but my mind screams back—what if this time it’s not? What if something is really wrong? What if this is it? I’ve spent so much time running from a danger that isn’t real.

Anxiety didn’t just make me afraid—it made me angry. Angry at myself for feeling this way. Angry at the world for not understanding. Angry at the people who told me to “just stop overthinking.” I couldn’t focus on anything but the chaos in my head. I lost pieces of myself, lost relationships, lost opportunities. And the worst part? I didn’t know how to stop it.

I felt stuck, trapped in a body I didn’t love, in a mind that didn’t feel like mine. I looked in the mirror and saw someone I didn’t recognize. But something in me refused to let go. A tiny flicker of hope, a whisper beneath all the noise, that kept me holding on. Maybe this wasn’t the end. Maybe I wasn’t beyond saving.

I knew I had to rebuild myself, but I didn’t know where to start. I was terrified. But I was also tired—tired of feeling this way, tired of letting anxiety control me. So, I took a step. I started therapy and I saw a psychiatrist. It wasn’t easy. Talking about everything I had buried for so long felt like ripping myself open. But for the first time in a long time, I wasn’t alone in this fight.


I began changing small things. Light exercise to release some of the tension in my body. Listening to podcasts that reminded me I wasn’t broken. Writing down the mess in my head so it didn’t have to stay trapped there. Journaling saved me—I wrote this when I was suffering, in the exact moment of my pain. These words are raw, unfiltered, real. Writing became my escape, my way of untangling the chaos. And slowly, I started seeing myself in those pages—the real me, not just the anxiety.

I chose to share my story with ADAA because of their dedication to supporting individuals affected by anxiety and depression. Their platform provides a compassionate space for people to connect, share experiences, and find helpful resources. I believe my story could contribute to raising awareness, reducing stigma, and offering hope to others who are struggling with anxiety.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that I’m still here. Despite the drowning thoughts, the what-ifs, the sleepless nights, the fear, the anger, the tears—I’m still here. Anxiety is loud, but I am learning to find quiet. I am learning that my thoughts are not truth. I am learning that I am more than this.

If you’re reading this and you feel like you’re drowning too—I need you to know that you’re not alone. I know how heavy it feels. I know how exhausting it is. But you are still here, and that means something. It means you are stronger than you think, even when you don’t believe it. Even in the darkest nights, I promise—the morning always comes.

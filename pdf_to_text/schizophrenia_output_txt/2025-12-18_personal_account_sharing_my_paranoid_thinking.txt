==================================================

Last night my internet went down. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting. I also clicked on the diagnostic but did not know what a DSN was. Because of my schizo- phrenia, it entered my mind that an acquaintance I met in my neighborhood was looking over his fiancée’s shoulder who seemed to be hacking my computer by messing with my internet. It also entered my mind that he thought I called him stupid, and he wanted to prove to me he was not.
With schizophrenia, I cannot control what suddenly pops into my head. In my experience, I’ve learned do not to react to these false thoughts of paranoia.
During the ordeal with my internet, I called my mom who tried to help me with my problem. She advised me to call my internet provider. I called them up and a re- corded message told me the internet was down in my neighborhood. The problem was solved, and it was not my neighbor. It was just paranoid thinking. With schiz- ophrenia, I cannot always control my thinking or what enters and exits my mind.
I never had these specific delusions before as far as an acquaintance messing with my internet. I have to re- member not to react to these pictures of my paranoia in my mind. It is important for me to not react to these thoughts out loud. The following day my internet was re- stored. One thing was for sure, my thoughts that night were racing, and I am glad I was able to take melatonin for sleep.
The following evening, I got a text from the same ac- quaintance who in my mind seemed to be messing with my internet. The text said he had a big trip to the grocery store, and he needed help bringing in his groceries. Had he messed with me last night I don’t think he would be asking me to do neighborly favors. Regretfully, I cannot control my paranoid thoughts, but I refuse to react to them out loud. It is important for me to realize that they will pass.
I am compliant with medication and keep appoint- ments with my psychiatrist. Chances are I will tell my psychiatrist about this experience. I wish I could tell my neighbor. I wish I could tell my neighbor just so I could give him an example of what it is like for someone living with schizophrenia at any given moment. However, with the stigma in today’s world, this matter-of-fact language about living with schizophrenia is not accepted. I might not feel like I can say it out loud, but I choose to say it through the written word. I want people who experience this kind of racing thoughts of paranoia to know they are not alone. I also want their loved ones to know what it is like for a person living with schizophrenia. Maybe one day we can talk out loud about schizophrenia-like any other condition.
